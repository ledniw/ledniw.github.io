					Fall-related hospitalisation is particularly common among older people. In 2011–12, 96,385 people aged 65 and over were hospitalised for a fall-related injury—three and a half times as many cases as 45–64 year olds (Figure 1). Of these, 65,965 (68%) were women compared with 30,420 (32%) men.

					The increasing rate of fall-related hospital admissions reflects Australia's ageing population (Figure 3). The number of fall-related hospitalisations for older people has increased 2.3% per year between 1999–00 and 2010–11.

			<h3>
				Safety in the home is a concern for everyone.
			</h3>

			<p>
				An occupational therapist can perform a safety audit of your home and make recommendations to decrease the risk of falls or injuries in your home. For example, an occupational therapist can recommend or check that bathroom grab rails are properly installed, and suggest additional ways to prevent falls and other injuries.
			</p>

			<p>Just to be safe…</p>

			<ul>
			    <li>Keep all important numbers by every telephone in the home. Where possible, pre-program emergency numbers.</li>
			    <li>Maintain a first aid kit in the home and in the workshop.</li>
			    <li>Ensure regular servicing of fuel burning appliances such as oven, water heater, space heater, wood stove, furnace, fireplace, etc. to reduce the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.</li>
			    <li>Install smoke detectors according to your local Fire Department's recommendations and keep these in working order.</li>
			    <li>Keep a flashlight beside the bed.</li>
			    <li>Install motion sensor lights on outside pathways; keep shrubbery trimmed back.</li>
			    <li>Get to know your neighbours and watch out for one another.</li>
			    <li>When away, even on weekend trips, follow tips to reduce the risk of home invasion. For example, adjust automatic timers on your lights, ask a friend or neighbour to pick up your newspapers, mail and check the house daily, arrange for snow removal or lawn cutting.</li>
			</ul>
