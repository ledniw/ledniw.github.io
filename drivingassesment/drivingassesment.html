			<h2>Driving Evaluations</h2>	
			<p>
				Driving is a skill of daily living that most people value. When injury, disease, illness or aging potentially affect your ability to drive, a comprehensive driving evaluation should be taken. These are different than screening tests to renew your licence.  This type of evaluation helps to determine if your medical condition or age may be affecting your driving ability.

			<h3>What is included in a driving evaluation?</h3>

			<p>
				There are two parts of the evaluation. One is done in a driving clinic and the second is done on the road.
			</p>


			<h4>Part one: Clinical evaluation</h4>

			<p>
				The occupational therapist begins the evaluation by determining the effects that the clientâ€™s medical condition, medications and functional limitations may have on the driving task.
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
			    	Visual screening is completed. This is a check to see that your eyes meet the minimum standards for driving in your province.  As well, how you move your eyes, your ability to judge distance and how well you see out to the side when you keep your eyes straight ahead. 
			    </li>

			    <li>
			    	The occupational therapist will also look at your arms and legs to see that you have enough movement and strength to control all of the features of the car. If you have some difficulties, adaptive equipment will be recommended to help you.
			    </li>

			    <li>
			    	Perceptual and cognitive abilities are evaluated by measuring your reaction time, seeing how you can pay attention to more than one thing at a time and completing some thinking skill tests to check your memory, problem solving abilities and how well your brain can interpret what you see.
			    </li>
			    
			    <li>
			    	The occupational therapist also takes a driving history, notes the type of vehicle driven, and discusses potential adaptive driving equipment.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Part two: On-road evaluation</h4>

			<p>In this part all aspects of the driving task are assessed and include:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
				    Physical ability and endurance to handle the vehicle.
				</li>

				<li>
			    	Cognitive/behavioural skills.  For example, ability to be aware of potential hazards, being aware of the full traffic environment.
				</li>

				<li>
				    Visual/perceptual skills. For example, how effectively you use your eyes, look around when you are driving and be able to take in the information you see correctly, make sense of it and act appropriately. 
				</li>

				<li>	
				    All responses to the traffic environments. For example, your ability to handle unusual situations, how you handle pedestrians, ability to cope with busy traffic areas or even the expressway.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Based on all the information gathered during both parts of the evaluation, the occupational therapist, usually in collaboration with a driver instructor, interprets results and makes recommendations based on performance strengths and limitations as well as on driving potential.
