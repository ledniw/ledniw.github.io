            <h2>How does the profession assess soft tissue injuries?</h2>

            <p>
                Occupational therapy assessment is conducted within various contexts – home, school, workplace and community. Occupational therapists look at the context within which the person functions, evaluating and commenting on the person’s ability or inability to perform daily tasks.
            </p>
            <img alt="falls figure1" src="img/tissue-injury.jpg" />

            <p>Findings, conclusions and recommendations reached by the occupational therapists are generally based on the following four areas.</p>

            <ul>    
                <li>Document review and/or information gathered from family and health care providers;</li>
                <li>Claimant interview to determine pre-accident activity level, pre-existing health status, accident-related history, course of treatment, progress to date, perception of injuries and functional implications;</li>
                <li>Physical assessment conducted using formalized and standardized testing provides objective information regarding musculoskeletal status and physical capacity;</li>
                <li>Functional assessment in which a claimant demonstrates the ability to perform (within medical restrictions) actual tasks within the home or workplace; review of daily activity schedule establishes activity tolerance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What role does the profession play in the management of soft tissue injuries and what does the “treatment” look like?</h2>
            <p>
                When intervention is recommended, the occupational therapist will devise an individualized treatment plan geared toward timely return to work or previous functional status. The plan would consider the person, the context or environment in which they perform daily tasks and the actual tasks and activities that need to be performed.
            </p>
            <h3>The plan may consist of any combination of the following:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Provide occupation-based therapy on a one-to-one or group basis to increase the person’s ability to meet job demands. Examples: work hardening in clinics or at the workplace or home, work/home trials, assertiveness training, chronic-pain programs and stress management;</li>
                <li>Provide instruction in symptom control strategies such as body mechanics, joint protection and energy conservation techniques;</li>
                <li>Fabricate and provide splints, orthotics; and</li>
                <li>Prescribe adaptive and safety equipment and modify home and/or workplace using ergonomic principles.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Can occupational therapists do third party assessments?</h3>
            <p>Occupational therapists can conduct a variety of assessments such as:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Physical demands analysis,</li>
                <li>Work site assessments,</li>
                <li>Ergonomic assessments,</li>
                <li>Activity of daily living assessments,</li>
                <li>Functional capacity and disability evaluations, and </li>
                <li>Post-job-offer assessments (largely for employers).</li>
            </ul>


            <p>Assessments can offer the following kinds of information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide information about a person’s abilities and limitations for return-to-work planning or everyday living;</li>
                <li>Prescribe aids, adaptations and modifications to the environment to increase the person’s ability to meet activity demands;</li>
                <li>Determine a viable graduated return-to-work or regular activity plan;</li>
                <li>Provide an independent opinion about a worker’s abilities that can enable parties to manage conflict and focus on return-to-work planning; and</li>
                <li>Assist with determining the cost of future care and adaptive equipment.</li>
            </ul>
