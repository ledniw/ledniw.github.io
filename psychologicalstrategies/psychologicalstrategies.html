			<h2>What is Occupational Therapy?</h2>

			<img class="right left-margined" alt="driving services" src="img/therapy.jpg" />

			<p>The idea behind occupational therapy is to use "occupation" or purposeful activity to help people with physical, psychological or social disabilities lead independent, productive and satisfying lives.</p>

			<h2>Neurological Occupational Therapy</h2>

			<p>
				An Occupational Therapist that specialises in neuro-rehabilitation will help people with a brain injury to be able to do the things they want to do. These could be daily activities that many of us take for granted, from grocery shopping or brushing your teeth, to more complex activities such as caring for children, succeeding in studies or work, or maintaining a healthy social life.
			</p>

			<p>
				After making an assessment of a person's needs, we work with the person to set realistic goals, and then create a programme that will give them the tools and strategies that they need to achieve them.
			</p>

			<p>
				The therapy is practical in nature and takes place wherever it would be most useful to the patient. In neuro-rehabilitation, it's definitely not the case that one size fits all, so we tailor-make an individual programme for each person.
			</p>

			<p>
				We also try to encourage family and carer involvement as their support is vital to the long-term success of the rehabilitation programme.
			</p>

			<p>
				Treatment may include advice and training in the use of adaptive equipment and techniques to manage everyday tasks.
			</p>

			<p>
				If there are cognitive difficulties, we can develop and teach planning, organisational and memory strategies to enable a person to become more independent in tasks like cooking a meal or travelling on public transport.
			</p>

			<p>			
				We can also provide education and advice on how to cope with the physical and psychological effects of a condition.
			</p>

			<p>
				In our experience, this tailor-made mix of support, counselling and practical assistance enables people to achieve as much as they can for themselves and to get the most out of life. And in doing so, occupational therapy can make the world of difference to a person's sense of independence and self-esteem.
